# Melanoma Detection - A Classical NN Approach
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- This assignment uses a dataset of about 2357 images of skin cancer types. The dataset contains 9 sub-directories in each train and test subdirectories. The 9 sub-directories contains the images of 9 skin cancer types respectively.
- We aim to classify cancer tyopes based on the 9 sub-types, only given an image.

## Conclusions
- Using the help of data augmentation, dropout layers and class rebalancing we managed to train a model with train accuracy at almost 95% and validation accuracy at about 80%
